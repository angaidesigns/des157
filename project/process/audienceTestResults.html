  <ul>
    <li>Looks very plain, could use some more work.</li>
    <li>I can see that this has to do something with stories but I don't know what else.</li>
    <li>Read tab doesn't go anywhere, I would just call it home if it is the home page.</li>
    <li>When I first jumped into this, I went straight to the about tab because that's where most info is.</li>
    <li>I would make the tabs more stronger, stand out more because they look like they blend in.</li>
    <li>I like that it was a fast responsive post when I hit create for the form.</li>
    <li>I feel like the form can use some work, it looks very plain and doesn't really do much for me.</li>
    <li>I would like to see more pictures, or something besides text.</li>
    <li>I like that the tabs don't open up into different pages, it looks more professional this way.</li>
    <li>I would like to see more of an instruction on how to use the site, I don't get much from reading the about tab.</li>
  </ul>
