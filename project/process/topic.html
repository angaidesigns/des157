  <h2>Story Submission Website/App: Our Stories?</h2>
  <p>Out of many things that can bring people together, one of those things is writing.
  Whether is it any form of genre, stories can be shared, made together, and experience.
  But there are many websites like this but with many limitations whether it due to licensing
  issues, character limitations, lack of directional design, and other things which can make
  it difficult to submit forms of writing to be shared around the world. In fact there are not
  many apps that also promote this kind of activity.
