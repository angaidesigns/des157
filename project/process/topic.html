  <h2>Technology for Peace: Story website/app</h2>
  <p>Stories or life advices are one way to understand each other. Everyone has
    some form of advice to give to others, some share personal stories to better
    understand someone's opnion. Regardless it is used to connect others to learn
    from others and to share to others. In this forum like "Humans of New York"
    kind of style.</p>
  <h2>Social Unity Campaign</h2>
  <p>Since Columbia is known for their coffee and how it has a huge part of their
    culture and heritage, what if we used coffee as a sort of over arching connection
    to promote unity and peace within all communties and social issues. Under one
    cup we all know and can love.</p>
  <h2>Unity App</h2>
  <p>I feel in this divided country we are in, relationships or all sorts can fall
    apart. I want to design an app to help bring people together in a sense of
    community and social issues we occur from time to time.</p>
