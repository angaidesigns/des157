  <h2>My Research</h2>
  <p>In my research I will be comparing two websites I know very well in posting
  stories that are shared to the public, and these stories can be a range from
  person experiences to other genres. Personal experiences or stories can tell a lot
  about a person and can create meaningful advice and creativity to share. We are
  all naturally drawn to reading something that sparks our interest and in return
  we enjoy it and take from it and learn from it and can connect us all.</p>

  <h2>Reddit: r/writing</h2>
  <p>Reddit is a forum posting site known to have many topics and sub topics, it
    can range from many catergories where people can post and get responses from
    other people on the site. Natually there is a thread dedicated to writing. And
    still thread people can post advice on writing, some common tips from character
    design, to placing a backstory at the right time, and the list goes on. What I
    find very interesting about Reddit is that the thread can be edited to look nice
    or to get the sense of theme on what this is about. It has a traditional forum
    like style so that you can find the post you want when upon search, and it filters
    through to the most recent post that is currently being commented. It can even
    display pinned posted of annoucements in this image which will stay on the first page
    as informational topics. The overall layout is simple and resembles a forum post
    which most people are familiar with and has a upper directory bar/nav bar, that
    can direct the user to another or more direct catergories.</p>

  <h2>Baka Tsuki: light novels</h2>
  <p>Baka Tsuki is a website of it's own that keeps up with updating light novels. Many
    go to this site whether you are the author of a very well know novel or show, or just
    someone starting out in writing, to post their work and get feedback but ultimately
    sharing some of the most creative pieces I have read. I myself am a big fan of light novels
    and how descriptive they are. The site is formally known to heavily influenced in Japanese
    culture such as manga and anime but essentially you would be getting the first content before
    other platforms. What I really like about the website layout is that it resembles Wikipedia or
    Wikia Fandom, again something many of us are familiar about. The layout is simple, the writings
    are put into catergories and in those catergories they are sorted alphabetical order making it
    easy to find the story you are looking for. The style is clean and not too distracting only to
    help you find the light novel you want to read and the side bar to the left gives information
    in relation to light novels and or updates to certain catergories. It's a very crisp clean site
    with little clicking to the next page.</p>
