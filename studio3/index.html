        <img src="images/london.png" alt="londonkey" id="london" style="opacity : 0;">
          <p id="londoninfo">One of the first key chain's I got once I moved to Davis. A friend
            of mine just came back from her study abroad in England and I happened to get
            London.</p>
        <img src="images/italy.png" alt="italykey" id="italy" style="opacity : 0;">
          <p id="italyinfo">Italy, the one time I decided not to go on vacation, some of my
            family went on a cruise to parts of Europe. This is probably one of my favorite
            too because the center spins around and keeps me entertained.</p>
        <img src="images/quebec.png" alt="quebeckey" id="quebec" style="opacity : 0;">
          <p id="quebecinfo">I always wanted to go to Canada but doesn't seem like that will happen
            anytime soon, so I guess this key chain will do. I got this during the end of summer
            from a friend.</p>
        <img src="images/hongkong.png" alt="hongkongkey" id="hongkong" style="opacity : 0;">
          <p id="hongkonginfo">Hong Kong! One of my recently obtained key chains for Christmas...kind
            of. I also enjoy this one because the top circle spins around, perfect to keep me
            entertained.</p>
        <img src="images/seuol.png" alt="seuolkey" id="seuol" style="opacity : 0;">
          <p id="seuolinfo">South Korea, Seoul Tower. One of the many South Korean key chains I
            have gotten from one of my cousins why she was on vacation about a year ago, so this
            is one of my oldest key chains in the collection.</p>
        <img src=" images/paris.png" alt="pariskey" id="paris" style="opacity : 0;">
          <p id="parisinfo">Paris, and the iconic Eiffel Tower. I got this key chain two years ago
            and it really means a lot because it was one of the first to start my collection. Also
            from the same cousin who went to South Korea.</p>
        <img src="images/taiwan.png" alt="taiwankey" id="taiwan" style="opacity : 0;">
          <p id="taiwaninfo">One of the newest key chains I gotten last year, of Fall quarter 2016. I
            just really like the tecture of this one, mainly everything I've gotten was either metal or
            plastic, so wood is a nice touch.</p>
